# HelloWorld
My first Solidity contract using Truffle and Ganache-CLI
It is a Hello World program made following the instructions in:
<li>
  <ul>
    * https://medium.com/etherereum-salon/hello-ethereum-solan-contract-4643118a6119 and 
    * https://medium.com/etherereum-salon/eth-testing-472c2f73b4c3
  </ul>
</li>
with a little tweaking since the versions of truffle and node have been update since the making of the guide.
