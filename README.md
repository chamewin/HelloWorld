# HelloWorld
My first Solidity contract using Truffle and Ganache-CLI
It is a Hello World program made following the instructions in:
<ul>
  Part 1
  <li>https://medium.com/etherereum-salon/hello-ethereum-solan-contract-4643118a6119</li>
  Part 2
  <li>https://medium.com/etherereum-salon/eth-testing-472c2f73b4c3</li>
</ul>
with a little tweaking since the versions of truffle and node have been update since the making of the guide.
